Developed a Bank Account Management System in C++ that implements essential banking operations such as account creation, cash deposits, and withdrawals. The system was designed with a focus on security, scalability, and maintainability using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Ensured data persistence and integrity by implementing robust file handling techniques. Account details are securely stored in a text file (Account.txt), allowing the system to retain and retrieve user data across sessions.

Implemented secure transaction processing by using temporary files for updating account balances. This approach ensures that any changes, such as deposits or withdrawals, are safely committed before the original file is replaced with the updated version.

Designed the system with future scalability in mind, allowing for easy enhancement and the potential addition of more complex banking features or advanced security measures.
